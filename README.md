# Distributed-Application

Complete project description can be found at http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~tongpingliu/teaching/cs5523/handouts/proj3-thread-performance.pdf

Main goal of this client-server distributed application is getting familiar with RMI concept and its imporatance in providing services to multiple clients at a time without any deadlock issues and serving clients in a synchronized way.

I found really a good pdf online on RMI for better understanding.
